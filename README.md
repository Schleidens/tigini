# tigini

This site is built using Django, a powerful and flexible web framework that allows us to create dynamic and interactive web applications. 
This blog was created as a learning project to explore the various features and capabilities of Django. While it will not be updated on a regular basis, 
we hope that it can serve as a useful resource for others who are also learning Django.
